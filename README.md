# ðŸš´ Bike Store Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard - Python & Streamlit

## Project Overview  
This project started with comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract key insights, including:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Engineering  
- Customer Analysis  
- Order Analysis  
- Revenue & Profit Analysis  
- Trend Analysis & Forecasting  

Following the analysis, an interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed for visualization and dynamic data exploration.

## Analysis Highlights  
- Clear seasonality with sales peaking in Spring and Summer and dipping in Fall and Winter  
- Steady growth observed in revenue and profit over the analyzed period  
- Prophet model provides interpretable long-term trend forecasts  
- Random Forest model offers more accurate short-term forecasts using features like Month and Season  
- Mountain and Touring Bikes are top revenue contributors  
- Accessories have lower revenue but potentially higher profit margins  
- Month-over-month revenue and profit growth display irregular patterns likely due to marketing campaigns and seasonal promotions  

## Dashboard Features  
- Interactive filters by Country, Product Category, Year, Month, Age Group, and Customer Gender  
- Visual analytics including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs  
- Customer insights by gender and age group  
- Monthly sales trend visualization highlighting seasonality  
- Identification of top-selling products  
- Sales forecasting powered by Prophet and Random Forest models  
- Business recommendations based on data insights

- Increase investment in high-performing product categories such as Mountain and Touring Bikes  
- Bundle underperforming products with popular ones to enhance perceived value  
- Use Prophet for strategic, interpretable long-term planning  
- Use Random Forest for accurate short-term operational forecasts
